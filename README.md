#TAILWIND-VS-BOOTSTRAP
🚀 Tailwind vs Bootstrap — My Frontend Experiment as a Developer
Recently, I designed two premium login pages — one using Tailwind CSS and the other using Bootstrap 5 — to explore how different frameworks shape UI/UX and developer experience.
✨ Tailwind Version:
Focused on complete design freedom, custom animations, and modern glassmorphism effects. Tailwind allowed me to build a futuristic SaaS-style interface with pixel-level control and a truly unique visual identity.
⚡ Bootstrap Version:
Focused on structured layout, rapid development, and scalable components. Using Bootstrap’s grid system and custom CSS, I created a professional split-screen authentication UI with strong branding and responsiveness.
💡 Key Learning:
Tailwind gives creative control.
Bootstrap gives structured efficiency.
Both together strengthen frontend mastery.
This experiment helped me understand how design systems impact real product UI. More such builds coming soon as I keep exploring modern frontend development.# TAILWIND-VS-BOOSTRAP
